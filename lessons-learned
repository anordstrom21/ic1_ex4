# Summarize your findings. Please comment on how useful you found this lesson and what could be
done to improve it.

* This is a whole new expirence for me. This was my first time using a terminal and GitHub
* I had to follow the provided videos closely, as the instructions listed were a little confusing
* Exercises 1 and 3 were easy to follow compared to 2 and 4
* Exercise 4 was extremely hard for me, I had to reach out to a fellow student to guide me in the right direction
* Exercise 1 was straightforward; I already had git installed from Xcode 
* Exercise 2 was rough since I had never made a commit before. Updating my text in the readme file was time consuming but pleasurable once achieved
* Exercise 3 was easy since the video incorparated how to properly add a remote URL (instructions skipped this/ git add origin remote URL)
* Exercise 4 was rough, even with video support. I found the instructions were more helpful this time but some frustrations with my text in different branches led me to reach out for additional help
* For next time, I would fix some spelling and spacing errors, since that is REALLY important
